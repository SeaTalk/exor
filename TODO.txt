# Begin to implement a basic dictionary structure [DONE]

Problem: __unable to move syscall out of main__
         The problem caused by using $1 as the placeholder of the macro 
         argument, which conflicts to the usage of immediate operand.
{Done} : Use parentheses to enclose the operand like $(_YourNumber_)

Problem: __Something wrong with loading the string length from memory__
         No problem with compiling, just giving no result. While no problem when passing an immediate number to register.

# Improve the dictionary structure to make it store data

1. __Change the Dictionary into a linked list structure__
   a. Create a new quadword to store the next entry address. Since it's
      not possible to access the absolute address, we use the initial
      address of Dictionary and offset to represent an entry address.

      _You cannot calculate the offset of the label before defined._
      _You also cannot_ update the stored data by updating the variable you assigned to it.

   [Done] A twice-addressing mechanic is implement. We setup a base address
   of dictionary, and then for each entry we use a quad to store the offset against base address. When addressing, we first load the offset into the register, and then load the address into the register with dictionary base and the offset right in the register.
      
   c. When we are going to implement the "define" word, which means we are
      going to add new entries at runtime, we have the problem, because we
      don
