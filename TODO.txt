# SanityCheck

Begin to implement the dictionary structure

Problem: __unable to move syscall out of main__
         The problem caused by using $1 as the placeholder of the macro 
         argument, which conflicts to the usage of immediate operand.
{Done} : Use parentheses to enclose the operand like $(_YourNumber_)

Problem: __Something wrong with loading the string length from memory__
         No problem with compiling, just giving no result. While no problem when passing an immediate number to register.
